# JavaFix
2 bat files designed to help manually install a JDK/JRE on Windows.

Both jars need you to insert a path manually.

`fixjar.bat` requires you to point directly to javaw.exe.

`fixenv.bat` requires you to point to the home directory of the JDK/JRE.
- The home folder, as of JDK16, has these subfolders: bin, conf, demo, include, jmods, legal, lib.
